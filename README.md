# WPFReactiveUI
A WPF application that enables loading of data files with x and y value pairs for graphical plotting. After loading, users can choose from linear, exponential, or power fitting models to fit the data. The application will display both the fitted coefficients and the corresponding curve on the graph, alongside the original data points.
